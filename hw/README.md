# Hardware

The NervesKey is a provisioned ATECC508A or ATECC608A. Both chips are
relatively inexpensive additions to devices that attach to an I2C bus. This
directory contains circuit board designs to add an ATECC508A/608A to Raspberry
Pis.

## 5-pin bottom solder-able module

The `proto4` directory is a hand solder-able module that can be mounted
underneath the Raspberry Pi or connected "upside down" to the top.

## NervesKey shim

We're working on a "shim" version that slides onto the Raspberry Pi's GPIO
header and can fit in between the Pi and a hat. No soldering required and it
is very small. For a permanent connection, it can be soldered down like the
version above.
